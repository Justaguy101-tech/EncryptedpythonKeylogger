# Encrypted Keylogger (Python)

> **Educational Use Only**
This tool is for **learning purposes only** - built to explore Python, encryption, keylogging, and ethical hacking techniques.
**Do not use it without permission. Always act ethically.**

## Overview

This is a **Python-based keylogger** that encrypts every keystrokes using AES-powered Fernet encryption. It saves encrypted logs into timestamped files and includes a decryption tool for reading them securely.

This project is meant to teach:
- Real-world use of 'pynput' (keyboard listener)
- Practical 'cryptography.fernet' encryption
- File handling and logging
- Red-team tool simulation (ethically)
